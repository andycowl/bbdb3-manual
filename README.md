bbdb3-manual
===============

The repository for the BBDB3 documentation set.

All documents were produced using [Sphinx] together with the
[sphinxemacs-contrib] extension.

[Sphinx]: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/
[sphinxemacs-contrib]: http://sphinxcontrib-emacs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Sphinx allows automatic documentation generation from the docstrings
embedded in the Emacs Lisp source files.

As the author of BBDB3, Roland Winker, had already meticulously
documented every single Emacs Lisp function, variable, keybinding,
constant and hook, this saved me a lot of work, for which I am
eternally grateful.

Sphinx allows generation of the manual in the following formats:

* texinfo
* PDF
* HTML
* readthedocs
* man pages
